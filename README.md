# Renderer
Welcome to my C++ OpenGL renderer! This repository contains the source code for a 
basic renderer engine that I've working on for the past couple of weeks while learning OpenGL.

This render is built using, or well, trying to at least, use modern C++ and 
modern OpneGL. I've included the complete source code.

This is still a work in progress.

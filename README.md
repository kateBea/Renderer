# Renderer
Welcome to my C++ render! This repository contains the source code for a 
basic render engine that I developed using C++ programming language. 
With this render, you would be able to create 2D and 3D images using 
various shapes, materials including lighting effects.

This render is built using, or well, trying to at least, use modern C++ and 
modern OpneGL. I've included the complete source code, along with some test 
case in the [test](/test) directory.

This is still a work in progress.
